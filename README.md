## Project Overview
This SQL query offers a comprehensive analysis of employee promotion patterns and performance rating within a multinational telecommunications company. By examining these metrics, the query aims to uncover key insights into the factors influencing career progression and overall employee performance, which are crucial for strategic decision-making in HR and organizational development.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop and execute an SQL query that analyzes employee promotion trends and performance ratings within an organization. The goal is identify patterns, correlations, and potential disparities in how promotions are awarded based on performance metrics, enabling data driven insights to inform HR strategies and improve talent management.

## Data Source
The data used in this project was provided by 10Alytics. The dataset contains a collection of the company's employee data which includes employee id, age, department, length of service, attrition, number of trainings, awards received and performance rating.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To gain insights, explore and understand the data related to employee promotions and performance ratings, the following EDA processes were involved
- **Inspecting Tables and Relationships by identifying the relevant tables for employee promotion and performance rating and understanding the relationships between the primary and foreign keys.**
- **By running basic descriptive statistics which involves counting records using SQL queries to count the number of records in each table and validate that the data is complete.**
- **Create frequency distributions to understand how performance ratings are spread across the employee population.**
- **Analyze the distribution of promotions across departments, tenure and performance level.**
- **Analyze how promotions and performance ratings have evolved over time and investigate the relationship between them.**
- **Examine the correlation between performance ratings and the likelihood or frequency of promotions.**
- **Explore how promotions and performance rating vary by department, role or location.**

## Evaluation Metrics
When evaluating employee promotion and performance rating in a SQL application, various metrics can be used to assess the effectiveness of promotion policies, identify trends and ensure fair practices. Here are some key evaluation metrics applied in this query:
- **Performance Rating Distribution.**
- **Correlation between Performance and Promotion.**
- **Promotion Equity.**
- **Employee Retention Rate Post Promotion.**
- **Promotion Frequency by Tenure.**
- **Promotion Rate by Performance.**

## Key Insights
Some of the key insights that are crucial for understanding the dynamics of career progression, talent management an overall organizational health are:

- **To identify how often promotion occur within the organization and understand the average time the employee take to receive their first promotion.**
- **To discover which department or roles have higher promotion rates.**
- **To analyze the spread of performance rating across the organization and observe how it changes over time.**
- **To access whether high-performing employees are being promoted frequently and to evaluate if promotions are distributed fairly across different demographics (gender, age), thus identifying potential bias.**
- **Measure retention rate if employees after receiving a promotion.**
- **To spot employees who consistently receive high performance ratings and rapid promotions, which may warrant closer attention for leadership roles.**
- **To detect outliers such as employee who have been promoted unusually quickly or slowly which could warrant further investigation.**

## Conclusion
In conclusion, by leveraging these insights, the organization can optimize their promotion and performance management processes, leading to more effective talent management, improved employee satisfaction and enhanced overall performance.
